Net Profit at Rs. 161,263 million however has been 3% lower than the previous year, mainly on account of sharing huge burden of under recoveries of the Oil Marketing Companies (OMCs), to the extent of Rs, 282,252 million. However, despite lower profits your Directors have recommended a final divided of Rs.14 per share (140%); maintaining the aggregate dividend at Rs. 32 per share (320%), at par with the last year, which happened to be the highest aggregate dividend. You may recall, in my last communiqu\u00e9, | had mentioned that the north-bound crude price is a major concern that the economies need to address on top priority. Crude oil price increased exponentially till July 2008; peaking at $147 per barrel on 11th July 2008. Its build up, though sudden, was perceived to be consistent and robust with high-growth global economy at that time. In reality, the historical levers of oil markets went out of the Grips of the producers as well as the consumers and were hijacked by the speculators on the \u2018commodity exchanges. \u2018One of the worst global recessions witnessed", "to be consistent and robust with high-growth global economy at that time. In reality, the historical levers of oil markets went out of the Grips of the producers as well as the consumers and were hijacked by the speculators on the \u2018commodity exchanges. \u2018One of the worst global recessions witnessed crumbling of established _ institutions, bankruptcy of major investment banks, closure of companies, liquidity crunch, job cuts, etc.; all extremely painful. High crude oil price has also been one of the contributory reasons for the devastating economic meltdown. The three digit oil regime stretched the energy deficient economies, developed or developing ones, to the extent that it gradually got detached from consumer spending and confidence. And as the global economies plummeted, one after another, oil demand moderated and with sentiments turning negative on commodity exchanges, the oil prices nose-dived. However, the present moderation is deemed to be \u2018temporary and demand is bound to bounce back once the economies gain comfort zone. \u2018As such, sustaining supplies remains the first priority for the industry; not only from the present assets, but even from all the plays which attracted attention in high-price regime like, deepwater, ultra-deepwater, oil sands etc. Commitment, investment and technology will play a major role in tapping this large pool of located and yet-to-be-discovered resources or from new and alternate sources of energy. Industry will have to eschew volatility which requires paradigm shift in policy framework; not only from producers and consumers but even at the commodity exchanges. Against this backdrop, if you evaluate the performance of your Company you will appreciate that the company focused on its core, maintained the right balance of growth portfolios and prudently invested for the future.

The IOR/ EOR schemes helped in improving recovery factor of fifteen major fields from 27.5% in 2000-01 to 33.1% in 2008-09.

During the year, your Company, alongwith share from. overseas assets of OVL and domestic joint ventures, registered 61.23 MMT of 0++OEG production; marginally (1%) lower than last year's highest-ever production of 61.85 MMT. Your Company is aggressively pursuing for overseas E&P projects for equity oil and gas; the third strategic pursuit of your Company. ONGC Videsh Limited (OVL), the wholly-owned subsidiary of your Company, is now participating in 40 E&P projects in 16 countries. During the year 2008-09, OVL acquired seven E&P projects in five countries; two being producing properties, and registered highest-ever ultimate reserves (3P) accretion of 135.08 MMT.

These investments were guided by the strategic pursuits of your Company and the listed priorities which have been mapped for sustained growth. Among the listed priorities, the first one is expeditious development of discoveries. You may be pleased to note that 45 out of 111 discoveries made since 2002-03 have already been brought to the stream and remaining discoveries are at different stages of appraisal. Your Company has constituted a new dedicated business unit for focused development of recent East Coast discoveries. Your Company has systematically been inducting state-of-the-art technology. At the same time, upgradation of existing equipment and infrastructure has also been taken up on rolling basis to debottleneck field infrastructure for better efficiency, With a vision to emerge as an Energy Company, the management has been aggressively exploring new sources of energy, like Coal Bed Methane (CBM), Underground Coal Gasification (UCG), Shale Gas, etc. Your Company has established meaningful leads in Coal Bed Methane (CBM) exploration recently. The pilot project at Parbatpur, Jharkhand is expected to commence production this year. UCG Pilot project at Vatsan, Gujarat is also expected to commence its operations next fiscal.

It has yet to stabilise and is expected to remain sluggish in the short-term, especially in the developed countries. The impact of recession is still not clear as the economic growth outlook is being revised and re-revised month-after-month. The real GDP of the advanced economies declined by unprecedented 7.5 percent during the fourth quarter of 2008 and output is estimated to fall almost as fast during the first quarter of 2009 (The World Economic Outlook, April 2009 by IMF). However, there are determined efforts to at least arrest the downturn. Largely the efforts are on to put the financial sector back to health through the use of macro economic policy levers. How much or how fast itis going to help will just be a wild guess; even though there are clear signs of recovery in the emerging economies like China and India. The IMF survey, World Economic Outlook (WEO 2009), in its latest update on July 8, 2009 pegs global economic growth at 2.5% in 2010, almost half percent higher than what it projected in its bi-annual April\u201909 report.

Rightly so, high oil price is considered to be one of the prime reasons for global economy meltdown last year. Thereafter, sudden and sharp decline in oil prices crippled the E&P industry world over. It averaged $39 a barrel during February 2009; however, it started gaining momentum thereafter on account of OPEC interventions and signs of global economy recovery. Presently itis ruling around $70 a barrel (WTI crude price; average for June 2009). Its bit early to presume the present price regime as.a sign of recovery; however, price at this level may help oil companies to keep up their commitments. + Demand-supply The economic downturn has set back the global crude oil and gas demand clock by about four years. As per CERA (Cambridge Energy Research Associates), the demand shock has completely given way to recession shock and has taken the global oil demand level to that of pre-2005. Between 2003 and 2007, crude oil demand grew by 7.6 milion barrels per day (mb/d) compared to 4.3 mb/d growth in the preceding five years; peaking to 87.2 mb/d in the fourth quarter of 2007. As cracksin global economy became visible, crude oil demand gradually started melting; lowering to 82.6 mb/d in the second quarter of 2009 (Source: IEA; Oil Market Report 11th June 2009), Decline in global oil demand has temporarily diminished the threat of supply crunch, as spare production capacity with OPEC is now expected to reach 7.78 mb/d by the next year, or 8% of global demand as per the International Energy Agency (IEA). However, this demand destruction is temporary.

However, this demand destruction is temporary. The moment the world is out ofthis crippling recession, demand for oil and gas is bound to bounce back Opportunities & Threats The steep decline in prices and the economy crunching credit squeeze has had a telling effect on investments and consequently future supply growth. This could well turn out to be a great setback once the global economy recovers. Supply sustainability is ikely to remain the biggest challenge for the industry as major oil fields are globally declining; few of those at a very disconcerting rate of over 9%. Production from known new discoveries can't offset this decline in near future. il production dipped or at best remained flat in almost all the regions except OPEC in the year 2008. Even Russia has shown a fall in production by around 1%. BP Statistical Review 2009 has brought out that the global proved oil reserves too have fallen; led by decline in FSU (Former Soviet Union), OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) countries and even Iran. hi \u2018An ONGC Engineer conducting a routine maintenance job on an onshore installation E&P companies spent around $96 bilion in 2008; a rise of 41% from $68.4 billion in 2007. However, this trend is expected to end at least in short to medium-term. A prolonged plunge in oil prices will curtail E&P companies\u2019 spending on new projects, particularly in the prospective but highly capital intensive areas lke oil sands, heavy oil, deep and ultra-deep waters, etc., and may limit the future production growth. Revisiting investment plans, reduction in budgets, project delays are some of the phenomenon which now characterize oil business. It is happening in case of smaller oil companies", "prospective but highly capital intensive areas lke oil sands, heavy oil, deep and ultra-deep waters, etc., and may limit the future production growth. Revisiting investment plans, reduction in budgets, project delays are some of the phenomenon which now characterize oil business. It is happening in case of smaller oil companies and service providers who are dependent on credit markets for financial resources. Larger cll companies, including NOCs and the IOCs, may also feel the pinch when support from service providers is constrained. In such scenario, rationalization of cost of cil field services, which emerged as the biggest challenge for the oil industry in boom days, becomes imperative The cost of developing a portfolio of upstream assets more than doubled from 2004 to 2008. This explosion in costs was the result of bottlenecks and shortages of people, equipment, inputs such as steel and engineering skills. Neutralizing these shortages would require support from resource holders and host countries through enabling tax regimes. CERA predicts that upstream costs may decline by as much \u2018as 40% by 2011. This would be good news for the industry and an opportunity to rebuild capabilities to meet the future demand CERA estimates that oil industry would need to spend more than US$150 billion per year on new oil supply over the next few years if industry costs do not decline. In case of decline, itis estimated to be US$90 billion per year. The Priorities Ensuring sustained supply of energy with green solutions has become the first requirement for inclusive growth of the societies. As such, on supply sie, there is a need for establishing linear correlation between demand and capacity buildup.

As such, on supply sie, there is a need for establishing linear correlation between demand and capacity buildup. However, this correlation has third and very important dimension ie, investment; which more or less boils down to the localized business interest of the countries or the corporates. Sustained investment will be required for locating new resources, maintaining production levels from the existing E&P assets and developing technology solutions for the future. For all these to happen, the first requirement is stable price regime which can only allow the industry to workout its priorities and map out long-term sustainable solutions. \u2018An ONGCian at an offshore platform in communication with base station (OVL operations at sub zero temperature at Sakhalin, Russia In case volatility and uncertainty prevails it will be a bad news for the energy starved world. Today's delays will provoke wide disparity in demand and supplies of tomorrow when the world is out of recession. Stable price regime with defined mechanism for sharing subsidy burden, would alo help your Company to chalk outs priorities in better manner. \u2018Though the price in $60-70/ barrels range, as itis ruling currently, is comfortable for the economies, the key producers are looking for prices in what they call \u201cGoldilocks range\", i.e., prices to be in a range which is neither too hot for consumers, nor too cold for the suppliers. This range is supposedly around $80 a barrel At the same time the industry will also be required to expedite commercialization of unconventional resources; like Coal Bed Methane (CBM), Underground Coal Gasification (UCG), Gas Hydrates, Shale gas, etc. These capital intensive solutions would also require innovative technology solutions. The other imperative is to look beyond hydrocarbons and develop alternate green solutions. Effective energy demand management at macro and micro", "expedite commercialization of unconventional resources; like Coal Bed Methane (CBM), Underground Coal Gasification (UCG), Gas Hydrates, Shale gas, etc. These capital intensive solutions would also require innovative technology solutions. The other imperative is to look beyond hydrocarbons and develop alternate green solutions. Effective energy demand management at macro and micro levels can help in easing pressure on hydrocarbons. Besides conservation, improving energy efficiency would require renewed thrust. Strategic pursuits Itisa matter of great comfort and satisfaction that the global gloom has not been allowed to descend on your company. ONGC has been able to maintain production levels and due to intensified exploratory efforts, itis able to accrete record hydrocarbon reserves. During 2008-09, ONGC accreted 284.81 MMT of initial in-place volume of hydrocarbons from its domestic acreages; the highest in last two decades. \u2018As is global trend, the major domestic fields of your Company have also entered in the natural decline phase. However, the IOR/ EOR schemes, which your Company is systematically implementing since 2001, have successfully been augmenting production and neutralizing decline from these matured fields. Thanks to these, recovery factor from fifteen major fields, where fourteen IOR/EOR schemes were implemented with an investment of more than Rs.140,000 millon, have increased from 27.5% in 2000-01 to 33.1% in 2008-09. Your company is contemplating of investing additional Rs. 160,000 million on seven more IOR/EOR and re-development projects which are under implementation.

Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements requires estimates and assumptions which affect the reported amountof assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of the reporting period. The difference between the actual results and estimates are recognized in the period in which the results are known or materialized, Government Grants Government grants for acquisition of fixed assets are initially treated as Capital Reserve and are subsequently recognized as income in the Profit & Loss Statement on a systematic basis over the useful life of the assets in the proportion in which depreciation on those assets is charged. Fixed Assets Fixed assets are stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment. Fixed assets received as donations/gifts are capitalised at assessed values with corresponding credit taken to Capital Reserve. All costs relating to acquisition of fixed assets til the time of commissioning of such assets are capitalised. Intangible Assets Costs incurred on intangible assets, resulting in future economic benefits are capitalized as intangible assets and amortized on written down value method beginning from the date of capitalization. Exploration, Development and Production Costs Acquisition Cost Acquisition cost of an oil and gas property in exploration/development", "assets are capitalised. Intangible Assets Costs incurred on intangible assets, resulting in future economic benefits are capitalized as intangible assets and amortized on written down value method beginning from the date of capitalization. Exploration, Development and Production Costs Acquisition Cost Acquisition cost of an oil and gas property in exploration/development stage is taken to acquisition cost under the respective category. Such costs are capitalized by transferring to Producing Property when itis ready to commence commercial production In case of abandonment, such costs are expensed. Acquisition cost of a producing oil and gas property is capitalized as Producing Property. Survey Cost Cost of Survey and prospecting activities conducted in the search of oil and gas are expensed in the year in which these are incurred Exploratory/ Development Wells in Progress All acquisition costs, exploration costs involved in drilling and equipping exploratory and appraisal wells, cost of driling exploratory type stratigraphic test wells are initially capitalised as Exploratory Wells in Progress til the time these are either transferred to Producing Properties on completion as per policy no. 6.4.1 or expensed in the year when determined to be dry or of no further use, as the case may be All wells under \u201cExploratory Wells in Progress\u201d which are more than two years old from the date of completion of drilling are charged to Profit and Loss Account except those wells where it could be reasonably demonstrated that the well has proved reserves and the development of the field in which the wells are located has been planned.

Cost of temporary occupation of land, successful exploratory wells, all development wells, depreciation on related equipment, facilites and estimated future abandonment costs are capitalised and reflected as Producing Properties. 643 65 66 66.1 662 663 94 92 93 10. Depletion of Producing Properties Producing Properties are depleted using the \u201cUnit of Production Method\u201d. The rate of depletion is computed with reference to an area covered by individual lease/licence/asset/amortization base by considering the proved developed reserves and related capital costs incurred including estimated future abandonment costs. In case of acquisition, cost of Producing Properties is depleted by considering the proved reserves. These reserves are estimated annually by the Reserve Estimates Committee of the Company, which follows the Intemational Reservoir Engineering Procedures. Production Costs Production costs include pre-well head and post well head expenses including depreciation and applicable operating costs of support equipment and facilites. Side tracking The cost of abandoned portion of side tracked exploratory wells is charged to Profit and Loss Account as dry wells The cost of abandoned portion of side tracked development wells is considered as part of cost of development wells The cost of sidetracking in respect of existing producing wells is capitalized if it increases the proved developed reserves otherwise, charged to Profit and Loss Account as workover expenditure.

In case, events and circumstances indicate any impairment, recoverable amount of these assets is determined. An impairment loss is recognized, whenever the carrying amount of such assets exceeds the recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is its \u2018value in use\" or \u2018net selling price\u2019 (if determinable) whichever is higher. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows from the use of assets and from its disposal at the end of its useful life are discounted to their present value at appropriate rate. \u2018An impairment loss is reversed if there is change in the recoverable amount and such loss either no longer exists or has decreased. Impairment loss / reversal thereof is adjusted to the carrying value of the respective assets, which in case of CGU, is allocated to its assets on a pro-rata basis. Subsequent to impairment, depreciation is provided on the revised carrying value of the assets over the remaining useful life. Abandonment Cost The full eventual estimated liability towards costs relating to dismantling, abandoning and restoring offshore well sites and allied facilities is recognized at the intial stage as cost of producing property and liability for abandonment cost is updated based on the technical assessment available at current costs with the Company.

However, no adjustment for impairment has been made to the financial information on the grounds that impairment will be considered at the OVL parent company level.
